# Description

This repository aim to implement a [CrowdSec](https://doc.crowdsec.net/) bouncer for the routers of [Unifi](https://www.ui.com/) to block malicious IP to access your services.
For this it leverages [Unifi API](https://ubntwiki.com/products/software/unifi-controller/api) to populate a dynamic Firewall Address List. Specically the Go Library [go-unifi](https://github.com/filipowm/go-unifi) is used.

# Acknowledgment

# Usage

For now, this web service is mainly thought to be used as a container.  
If you need to build from source, you can get some inspiration from the Dockerfile.

## Prerequisites

You should have a Unifi appliance and a CrowdSec instance running.  
The container is available as docker image `ghcr.io/teifun2/cs-unifi-bouncer`. It must have access to CrowdSec and to Unifi.

Generate a bouncer API key following [CrowdSec documentation](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/cscli/cscli_bouncers_add)

## Procedure

1. Get a bouncer API key from your CrowdSec with command `cscli bouncers add unifi-bouncer`
2. Copy the API key printed. You **_WON'T_** be able the get it again.
3. Paste this API key as the value for bouncer environment variable `CROWDSEC_BOUNCER_API_KEY`, instead of "MyApiKey"
4. Start bouncer with `docker-compose up bouncer` in the `example` directory
5. It will directly communicate with your Unifi appliance and configure Rules and IP Groups

## Configuration

The bouncer configuration is made via environment variables:

# Troubleshooting

## Homelab fork: stable firewall groups

This fork is based on upstream v1.4.0. It sorts the complete blocklist before
splitting it into firewall groups and skips group writes when their membership
has not changed. Controller membership is loaded on startup, so restarting the
bouncer also skips unchanged group writes. Configuration options are unchanged.

The first reconciliation of groups created by the upstream bouncer can move
addresses into the sorted layout. Subsequent updates apply real decision changes
without randomly redistributing the blocklist. This reduces new audit-log growth;
it does not remove existing audit history or tune MongoDB.

Release images are published at `ghcr.io/porthorian/cs-unifi-bouncer`. Pull requests
and main run regression tests, static checks, and builds for Linux amd64, arm64,
and arm without publishing. Release tags publish only after verification passes.
The nonroot static base is pinned in `.ko.yaml`; CI also verifies that the image
manifest actually contains all three supported architectures.

## MongoDB CPU Overload

Some users have reported that the UniFi control plane becomes slow or unresponsive after running the bouncer for a while. This is caused by the UniFi controller logging every individual IP address change to the `admin_activity_log` collection in MongoDB, which can grow very large (1GB+) and cause high CPU usage (300%+).

**Symptoms:**

- UniFi console becomes slow or unresponsive
- Console shows "Getting ready" for extended periods
- `mongod` process at 300%+ CPU usage
- Network continues to work, but control plane is unusable

**Solution A: One-time MongoDB collection capping (no SSH credentials required)**

This fix caps the `admin_activity_log` collection to 10 MB. Once applied, MongoDB automatically discards older entries to stay within the limit, preventing the collection from growing out of control. No bouncer configuration changes are needed.

[Original Discussion](https://community.ui.com/questions/High-CPU-usage-MongoDB/535a4ab9-9a09-45f8-9ed7-a17560912edf?reply=16)

SSH into your UniFi device and run:

```shell
# Drop the collection so it can be recreated as a capped collection
mongo ace --port 27117 --quiet --eval 'db.admin_activity_log.drop()'

# Cap the collection to 10 MB
mongo ace --port 27117 --quiet --eval 'db.runCommand({ convertToCapped: "admin_activity_log", size: 10000000 })'
```

> **Note:** The `drop` command is optional — `convertToCapped` works on an existing collection too and is sufficient on its own if you prefer not to lose existing log entries.

> **⚠️ Important:** UniFi firmware/software updates may recreate the `admin_activity_log` collection without the capped configuration, causing the issue to reappear. If you notice the slowdown returning after an update, re-run the `convertToCapped` command above. If you prefer a fully automated fix that survives updates, use Solution B instead.

**Solution B: Automatic periodic cleanup via SSH (bouncer-managed)**

Enable the audit log cleanup feature by setting these environment variables:

```yaml
environment:
  UNIFI_LOG_CLEANUP: "true"
  UNIFI_LOG_CLEANUP_USER: "root"
  UNIFI_LOG_CLEANUP_PASSWORD: "your-ssh-password"
```

This feature connects via SSH to your UniFi device periodically (based on `UNIFI_LOG_CLEANUP_MINUTES`) and cleans up the verbose audit log entries, replacing thousands of individual IP entries with a simple "Updated from bouncer" message. This preserves the audit trail while eliminating the performance impact.

**⚠️ Security Warning (Solution B only):**

This feature requires enabling SSH access on your UniFi device and storing the SSH password in your configuration. Please be aware:

- **This is a workaround** for a problem caused by UniFi's excessive audit logging, not our intended method of operation
- Enabling SSH and storing credentials increases your security risk
- SSH uses `InsecureIgnoreHostKey` for host key verification (accepts any host key)
- Only enable this feature if you are experiencing the MongoDB CPU overload issue
- Use this at your own risk and ensure your network is properly secured
- Consider using strong passwords and restricting SSH access to specific IP addresses if possible

**Note:** You need to enable SSH access on your UniFi device and know the root password. The SSH password is typically the same as your device's management password.
